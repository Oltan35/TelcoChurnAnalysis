# TelcoChurnAnalysis
Telco Churn Prediction refers to the process of predicting which customers of a telecommunications company are likely to cancel their services in the near future. This can be achieved by analyzing various customer data points, such as demographics, usage patterns, and customer interactions, in order to identify factors that contribute to churn.

By leveraging machine learning algorithms, Telco Churn Prediction models can be developed to analyze customer data and make accurate predictions about which customers are most likely to churn. This information can then be used to proactively reach out to customers who are at risk of leaving and offer them incentives to stay, ultimately reducing customer churn and increasing customer retention rates.

The Telco Churn Prediction project typically involves:

Data collection
Data cleaning
Exploratory data analysis
Feature engineering
Model selection
Model evaluation
The final outcome of the project is a predictive model that can be used to identify at-risk customers and take proactive steps to retain them.

Business Problem:

It is expected to develop a machine learning model that can predict customers who will leave the company.
